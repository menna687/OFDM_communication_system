function coded_bits = ChannelCoding(bit_seq ,n ,m)

%{
Inputs:
       bit_seq: Data bits
       n: Codeword length (Number of bits in the codeword)
       m: Messege block length in codeword
Outputs:
       coded_bits: Encoded data
Description:
       This function (channel coding block) takes as input the raw data bits ,performs
       a linear block coding operation which takes an input of 4-bit block and map it into a 7-bit codeword
       by multiplying by a 7 Ã— 4 generator matrix to produce a set of coded bits.
